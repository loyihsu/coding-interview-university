# Interview Process & General Interview Prep Notes

## ABC: Always Be Coding

- Master at least one multi-paradigm language (e.g. C#, C++, Java, PHP, Python or Ruby)
- [Complexity Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- Practice Implementing Common DS, don't use common libs:
    - Vector (dynamic array)
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Circular Queue
    - Hash map
    - Set
    - Priority Queue
    - Binary Search Tree
    - ...

- Programming is just the most straightforward part of being an engineer.

## Whiteboarding

- Slow Down: Slow-down, chill-out, and try to write as neatly (organised) as possible.
- Ask Questions: Many interview questions are intentionally vague to see how you handle uncertainty and what assumptions you make. If you are implementing an algorithm, what are the constraints? Memory, runtime, size of inputs, etc.
- Code how you'd normally code
- Check your work
- Practice
- Do your research
- Have fun

### Effective Whiteboarding during Programming Interviews

- Notes and figures on the side: use a cornor of the whiteboard to note reqs or figures.
- Write clearly.
- Use space efficiently. (most interview questions span at least 15-20 lines of code)
- Edits are part of the game: Don't be afraid to change code.
- Practice!

## Recruting

- **Recruiter Screen**
    - Recruiting Process != Black Box
    - 'Are you passionate about your work?'
    - Share!
        - open source (GitHub)
        - published work
        - social media
        - attend conferences, meetups
        - be somewhere!
- **Technical Screen**: Usually Coding thru Collab Docs
- **Onsite Interview**: Whiteboarding
- **Interviewer Debrief & Candidate Review**
- **Offer**

- 'You can't get discouraged. This preparation we're doing right now isn't for a specific event. It isn't for a specific interview. This is part of our lives now. If you get nothing this year, you're just preparing for next year.' --- Sean Lee
- 'You don't need to put down how many times you failed on your resume.' --- Sean Lee
